# Enhancing-Stock-Price-Prediction-with-Stacking-Ensemble-and-Dimension-Reduction-Techniques
The stock market is a complicated and unpredictably changing market that is affected by many different things, including the state of the economy. Algorithms that use machine learning (ML) can be used to forecast stock market movements and spot investing opportunities. In our study, we investigate how different ML algorithms and dimension reduction methods might be applied to stock market forecasting. The presented models were developed using historical stock market data, including technical indicators. The effectiveness of the suggested models was demonstrated using the TCS stock market dataset, with dimension reduction performed using Minmax scaling and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). To integrate the benefits of many regression techniques, such as Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, K Neighbours Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor, an ensemble learning model was presented. Performance measures including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) were used to assess the model's performance. According to the findings of our study, the suggested ensemble learning model, which incorporates dimension reduction techniques, offers a viable method for stock market prediction.
<h1>Architecture of our proposed model</h1>
We have designed an ensemble learning model where we are choosing some common machine learning algorithms which include Linear Regression, Lasso regression, KNN, Random Forest and Decision Tree. The algorithm with the highest result is then used to find the optimal result.<br>    
1) The stock price of TCS is taken into account from National Stock Exchange of India data from Yahoo Finance. The data is taken over a period of 15 years (15th April 2008 to 13th April 2023).<br>
2) Using various Technical Indicators which include SMA, EMA, ATR, RSI. We can better understand the underlying patterns and trends in the data by applying technical indicators to our stock dataset. With the aid of these indicators, we can spot potential buying or selling opportunities, gauge the force of a trend, and gauge how the market as a whole feels about a particular stock or group of stocks.<br>
3) The preprocessing module MinMaxScaler is used to scale our data and reduce large variations in it. It can assist in making sure that all features contribute equally to the analysis and prevent any one feature from dominating the model by rescaling the data to a range of 0 to 1. By lessening the influence of outliers and extreme values, it can also aid in enhancing the accuracy and performance of some algorithms, such as neural networks.<br>
4) After preprocessing dimension reduction is performed, it can facilitate analysis by lowering the number of features in the dataset and enhance the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms. This can also aid in enhancing the results' interpretability and lowering the possibility of overfitting, which happens when an overly complex model fits the data's noise rather than its underlying patterns.<br>
5) The data is divided into 80% train data and 20% test data. This split helps to ensure that the model is trained on a representative sample of the data and that they will be evaluated on unseen data to measure their generalizability.<br>
6) The training data is used to train all the algorithms within the ensemble learning model. And the performance of the model is checked using the test data.<br>
